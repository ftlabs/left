				<p>As the prospect of Britain crashing out of the EU without a deal on March 29 looms ever larger, parliamentary discipline is falling apart. Both main party leaders are being forced into concessions. Faced with a mutiny by a dozen pro-EU ministers, prime minister Theresa May has said that if MPs fail to back her withdrawal agreement next month, she will grant votes to endorse a no-deal <a href="https://www.ft.com/brexit" data-trackable="link">Brexit </a>or to extend the withdrawal process by up to three months.</p><p>After years of insistence that Brexit will happen on time, come hell or high water, this is a welcome step towards bringing some sanity to the debate. But it is insufficient. If an extension is to happen, it should be for much longer.</p><p>Sadly, even as she dangled a possible extension, Mrs May insisted it must be short and limited. As she stressed, this does not remove a no-deal outcome. It merely moves back the &#x201C;cliff edge&#x201D;. It would prolong the purgatory for businesses, which must decide whether to press ahead with investments, sign contracts, or load goods on to ships without knowing the trading framework they will face just weeks from now.</p><div class="o-ads in-article-advert advert" data-o-ads-name="mpu" data-o-ads-center="true" data-o-ads-label="true" data-o-ads-targeting="pos=mid;" data-o-ads-formats-default="MediumRectangle,Responsive" data-o-ads-formats-small="MediumRectangle,Responsive" data-o-ads-formats-medium="MediumRectangle,Responsive" data-o-ads-formats-large="Responsive" data-o-ads-formats-extra="Responsive" aria-hidden="true"></div><p>In itself, the latest manoeuvre is one more instance of the prime minister&#x2019;s favoured strategy of procrastination. But by opening the door a crack to an extension, Mrs May has given MPs the opportunity to kick it wide open.</p><p>The prime minister is entitled to put her deal before parliament again, especially if she secures tweaks from the EU to the Northern Ireland backstop that might help it win a majority. By making clear that the alternative is not a no-deal exit but a delay, she might finally persuade hardline Leavers in her party to back her agreement or risk Brexit slipping from their grasp. Yet pro-remain Tories may now be less ready to support Mrs May&#x2019;s deal. Some feel a second referendum could be in sight after last week&#x2019;s departure of nine Labour MPs forced the opposition leader, Jeremy Corbyn, to make a concession of his own and back this option.</p><p>Should it become clear next month that so many MPs remain opposed to her deal that it has little chance of ever being passed, Mrs May should drop any further attempts to force it through parliament. The prime minister should then seek not a three-month prolongation of Article 50. Instead, she should propose the kind of &#x201C;strategic extension&#x201D; some EU officials are now mooting of at least nine months, even a year or more. If the prime minister is not prepared to do that, MPs should find ways of forcing her to do so &#x2014; for example by backing an amendment to the extension motion, which officials are suggesting may be permitted.</p><p>An extension must be accompanied by a new direction. The country deserves something better than the shambles of the past six months. The hardliners have had more than two years to convince parliament of their vision of Brexit. They have failed. Now, as MPs finally find their voices, there is an opportunity to forge a cross-party consensus for a more workable Brexit. </p><p>This newspaper has been in favour of the UK maintaining a customs union with the EU, a position that would respect the 2016 referendum result, protect vital trading relations, and go some way to resolving the Irish border conundrum. It would be likely to win the support of a majority in the House of Commons. If parliament continues to be deadlocked, however, the issue should be returned to the British people through another referendum. </p><p>Two and a half years on, the British public have a clearer idea about the costs of an orderly departure. Therefore, if parliament cannot come to a consensus, there is another path for Mrs May and one which would make good use of an extension. She could agree to put her deal to the British people in a referendum versus the option of remaining in the EU. Voters would then face the choice between a real Brexit agreement and the status quo. </p><p>Leaving the EU was always an act of grievous self-harm for the UK, severing its privileged links with its biggest trading partner and a single market of more than 500m people, harming its security and diminishing its standing in the world. </p><p>In the 2016 referendum voters were sold an illusory Brexit. In a new plebiscite, they would have the chance to reaffirm their support for leaving the EU on the terms available. Or they may conclude that remaining in the EU bloc is the better option. Either way, the choice would be a real one.</p>
